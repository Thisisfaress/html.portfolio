            <td><h1>MOHAMED FARESS</h1><p>I'm Mohamed Faress 27, Hold a diploma in Business Management and have over a year of experience in logistics and transport operations. I have demonstrated leadership as an agency manager, overseeing teams, improving operational efficiency, and managing administrative tasks. With solid skills in transport management, driver coordination, and handling transport regulations, I also have knowledge of key business software like TMS (Transport Management System). After that, I realized that this domain wasn't for me, leading to a switch to web development, where I feels more connected.</p></td>
